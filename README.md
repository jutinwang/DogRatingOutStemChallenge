# Outstem Front-end Challenge 2023

## Description
This is my submission for the **OutStem Front End Challenge** created by **Justin Wang**

This website is designed to allow users to rate pictures of dogs.
You can rate dogs using stars on a scale of 10 to 15 **_(BECAUSE NO DOGS ARE BELOW 10/10!)_**
Users can choose filters to specifically get a certain kind of dog or a random one.

People can also see what dogs they've previously rated and what they look like. The table can
be sorted from largest rating first and smallest rating first.

## Tools Used
This project was created with React, which means it was coded in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript and JSX.
